# 🌍 Interplanetary Age & Weight Calculator

**Ever wondered how old you'd be on Mars or how much you'd weigh on Jupiter?**  
This playful Python program lets you explore your **age** and **weight** across our solar system — where gravity and time play by their own rules. 🪐

## 🚀 Features

- 🌞 **Two-in-One Tool** – Choose between **Age Calculator** or **Weight Calculator**  
- 🧮 **Accurate Ratios** – Uses scientifically based orbital and gravity ratios  
- 💬 **Interactive Prompts** – Friendly, conversational flow for a fun experience  
- 🌌 **All Major Planets** – Mercury → Neptune, with Earth as your reference point

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🪙 Weight Mode:
Your weight changes with gravity!  
> Formula:  
> `Weight on Planet = Earth Weight × Gravity Ratio of Planet`

### ⏳ Age Mode:
Each planet takes a different time to orbit the Sun.  
> Formula:  
> `Age on Planet = Earth Age ÷ Orbital Ratio of Planet`

## 💻 Example Run

*** Hey Fellas! Welcome! ***
Here you can find your age and weight on different planets in our solar system!

So, do you want to find out your age or weight on different planets?
Type 'Age' for age calculator or 'Weight' for weight calculator: weight

Are you ready to find out how much you would weigh on different planets?!
Type 'Yes' to continue or 'no' to exit: yes

Enter your weight on Earth (in kilograms): 60
Enter the name of the planet you want to calculate your weight on: Jupiter

--------Your weight on JUPITER would be: 140.4 kilograms--------
Wow! Isn't that interesting?
